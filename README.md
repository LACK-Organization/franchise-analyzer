Franchise Analyzer is a program that compares two franchises from the same company based on the data provided to determine a "success score".

In this [link](mcdonalds-case-study.pdf), you can find our case study explanation outlining how we used the program to compare the Queen-Spadina and the AGO McDonald's and our results.
